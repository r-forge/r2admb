* weaken ggplot2 dependency, if possible

* comparisons with PBSadmb?

* add MCMC quantiles etc. to summary: coeftab?

* confint method?
-   "quad" if only se/vcov known
-   "profile" if known
-   MCMC: quantile/HPDinterval if known

* better setup detection, error trapping:
   comments on adcomp/adlink/admb scripts

* more checking of dat/pin files:

* ?? formula interface???

* read bar (binary) rather than par file?

* evaluate objective function by fixing vals

* add phase support

* finish bounds support: check bounds on initial parametesr?

* better strategy for saving originals when changing case/auto-generating
inputs -- temporary filenames, or temp directory??

* TEST check for variables with "." in the name: stop? change to "_" and warn?      

* check for random effects vectors (don't redefine if already there)

* parameter/data order checking?

* more checks/flags of compiling step -- stop if error

* more info on thinning etc. of MCMC saved/printed in final object

* allow just compilation, just run from previous compilation ...
